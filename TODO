- Make the reset code in another file.
- In reset, before ```jsr init```, change to ```jsr init_swbank```. This code 
is responsible of switching banks so the init code can be called, DATA be
reachable, constructors be reachable and if necessary, enable EXRAM.
- reset calls main, if it returns put some defined garbage into APU and loop 
forever; main shall not return, ever! (Except if game is finished? So it would
be a simple way to put game in "stall state"?)
- Before calling main, reset would call ```main_swbank```, it makes main 
reachable, no more.
